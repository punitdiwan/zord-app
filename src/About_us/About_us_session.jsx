            <h2 >A Bunch of Developers to a Company</h2>
            <p>Founded during the Pandemic, to help and grow local businesses near our neighborhood. A bunch of software developers from Bangalore and <br /> Chennai joined together to solve local SMEs' problems using technologies like ReactJS, Angular, Flutter, Node and etc.
              <br />

              Each problem had different solutions. Every solution had the same enthusiasm.

              We are highly driven by the joy and wholesomeness of helping and seeing businesses grow
              <br /> because of the crafts we know: Software development, Mobile app development, Web app development, UI/UX design, Digital Marketing and etc.
              <br />
              2 years ago during the peak of the pandemic, we became Zordapp Solutions.

              We got back-to-back projects by not SEO but something much better, <br /> WOrd-of-mouth. We became local heroes for SMEs. Our prices were much cheaper than your regular service companies but the Quality was nothing less than a world-class product.

              Ever since then, we decided to extend our services worldwide and to help <br /> businesses across the globe to reach new heights.

              Here at Zordapp Solutions, We outsource On-demand software <br /> developers who are crafty and passionate about web and mobile app development. We sit with our customers, know and understand their needs and work with them in bringing their ideas into reality.
